# Personal-Portfolio
This page was created with the intent of having one space to easily access my work throughout this course. The eventuality will be to use this as a one stop shop for potential employers. Most employers really only see what your experience is in a resume and this will allow for employers to see what kind of work I have completed. I plan to continously update this page as I work through my bootcamp that will help me during applications in the future.

Throughout this, I've learned much more about starting code from scratch and editing styles utilizing flex box concepts. It was especially challenging when trying to get the format correctly when adjusting the screen sizes so that the content did not overlap. I did spend extra time looking at styling affects I could place on the page and experiemented quite a bit. I've enjoyed trying out the changes I could make within CSS and I'm excited to learn more in the future with JavaScript.
